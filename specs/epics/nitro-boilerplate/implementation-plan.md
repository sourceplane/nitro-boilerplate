# nitro-boilerplate — implementation plan

Three milestones, one task each, each landed as one pull request.

## NI0 — the spec (NI-1)

The repository is born with express-api's frame — `intent.yaml` (dev
verify-only, stage, prod after stage; the placeholder workspace
`ws_CHANGE_ME`, so CI plans nothing until it is linked), `ci.yml` byte for
byte turso-starter's (as hono-api carries it), the shared TypeScript and
ESLint configuration, the wrangler renderer, the pnpm workspace and turbo
pipeline, and the spec index — and this doc set and the three task
contracts land on it.

## NI1 — Nitro on Workers (NI-2)

- `apps/api/server/routes/index.ts` is upstream's, its title and heading
  read from `SITE_NAME` (HTML-escaped) and its Vercel line and links now
  Cloudflare's; `apps/api/server/identity.ts` holds `SITE_NAME`;
  `apps/api/server/routes/health.ts` answers `/health` from the request's
  bindings; `apps/api/nitro.config.ts` is upstream's plus the
  `cloudflare_module` preset; `apps/api/LICENSE.md` is the example's MIT
  licence.
- `nitropack` pinned to 2.13.4 (design §3); `apps/api/wrangler.jsonc`
  (`nodejs_compat`, `.output/server/index.mjs` and `.output/public` with
  `ASSETS`, per-environment vars) and `component.yaml`
  (`cloudflare-worker-turbo`) with a smoke over `/health`.
- `tests/api`: vitest building the app with Nitro (`node-listener`),
  serving it on Node and calling `/`, `HEAD /`, `/health` with and without
  an environment, and a 404, over HTTP.
- The README: run, test, deploy; how each Vercel piece maps.

Done when typecheck, lint, test and build are green, and `wrangler dev`
over the build answers every route.

## NI2 — a baseline (NI-3)

express-api's machinery on this tree: the card, the build document (one
landing, `01-product`, then the record, `02-docs`), `.baseline/` (identity,
the product's README, task contracts), the rename engine (the `SITE_NAME`
seam alone), the bootstrap helpers, the deployment-record renderer (probing
`/health` and `/`), the phase pages, the context pack, and the baseline's
tests — with the end-to-end tier replaying the stage lane in a staged job
tree (no build output in it), checking the dry run is one bundle with
`ASSETS`, and reading every route from the staged Worker under `wrangler
dev`. Done when every Baseline CI tier is green; tagged `baseline-v1`.
